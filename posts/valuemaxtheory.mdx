title: value max theory
date: 2024-05-06
---

the problem of building a successful business in any industry can be reduced to the problem of maximizing the value you provide to others [^1]


```math
\text{successful business} = \max (\text{value provided to others})
```

## how do we define value?

The value of any business can be defined with the following equations:

The value a business provides it's customers[^2]

```math
\text{Value}_{\text{offer}} = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Percieved Likelihood of Achievement}}{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{Efforts \& Sacrifice}}
```
where
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{offer}} > \text{Price}
```

The value of a SaaS business (< $1m ARR)[^3]
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{SaaS}} = (\text{MRR} - \text{Monthly CoGS}) \times 12 \times ~4
```

The value of an e-commerce business 
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{e-commerce}} = \text{Annual EBITDA} \times ~3
```

The value of an agency business
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{Agency}} = \text{Annual EBITDA} \times ~3
```

The value of a marketplace, social app, or your own personal network
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{network}} = \text{Metcalfes Law} = (\text{\# nodes in network})^2
```

These are just rough estimates, the actual numbers vary based on many factors.

## great. math equations... how does this help me make money?

the real fun happens when you learn to [change things in the real world](https://twitter.com/dillionverma/status/1786065783463858582) resulting in the value you provide others to go up.

i notice that it's directly correlated to customers getting happier, and also your own bank balance going up. 

**everyone just wins using this mental framework.**

just to be clear - i've not invented anything new here. just connected important concepts from different fields to construct a mental framework for how to operate an effective business.

## how can i start value maxxing?

### 1. Theoretical Understanding (10-50 hrs)

- [Read $100m offers by Alex Hormozi](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58612786) to understand the value equation and how to tweak the variables in the real world
- [Read how to sell a business](https://blog.acquire.com/acquire-biannual-acquisition-multiples-report-2024/). This is so you conceptually understand how others value your business as an entity, and you can work towards value maxxing from day 1, and [not waste time](https://twitter.com/dillionverma/status/1786065783463858582). This theory applies to any business.

### 2. Practical Experience (varies per person, but if you're focused maybe 1-5 years? hard to predict.)

you need hands on experience providing value to others. you cant study your way through this one. theres no way around this.

here are the best ways to get practical experience ranked in order of effectiveness from most effective to least effective (based on my own experience)

1. build something yourself
1. build something with a friend
1. get 1:1 direct mentorship from someone a few steps ahead of you
1. learn from an internship
1. learn from a job

there's no shortcut here. do the work. [this part is the hardest](https://twitter.com/dillionverma/status/1786784385687072895).

## what next?

i'll be testing this theory and reporting back with results in my own life.

there's a ton of nuance missing but the above equations convey the overall theory

ill add more nuance as time goes on, but if you already vibe with the theory, please [open a PR on github](https://github.com/dillionverma/valuemaxtheory.com) to add more details!

if you have evidence to support or reject this theory, please [let me know on github](https://github.com/dillionverma/valuemaxtheory.com).
