title: value max theory
date: 2024-05-06

the problem of building a successful business in any field can be reduced to solving what i'm calling the value max equation in your own lives.

**the theory is simple: if you $$max(value)$$ in all aspects of your business you'll be successful.**

---

## how do we define value?

The value of any business can be defined with the following equations.

The value you offer to your customers:

```math
\text{Value}_{\text{offer}} = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Percieved Likelihood of Achievement}}{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{Efforts \& Sacrifice}}
```

The value of a SaaS business
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{SaaS}} = (\text{MRR} - \text{Monthly Cost}) \times 12 \times 4.2
```

The value of an e-commerce business
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{e-commerce}} = (\text{MRR} - \text{Monthly Cost}) \times 12 \times 3
```

This is a special case for if you're building business around a network such as a social app.

The value of an agency business
```math
\text{Value}_{\text{Agency}} = (\text{MRR} - \text{Monthly Cost}) \times 12 \times 6
```

(Metcalfes law)

```math
\text{Value}_{\text{network}} = (\text{\# nodes})^2
```

Using median valuation multiples taken from [acquire.com 2024 business acquisition report.](https://blog.acquire.com/acquire-biannual-acquisition-multiples-report-2024/)

Constraints:
```math
\text{Value} > \text{Price}
```
No matter what you do, the value you produce must be greater than the price you charge.

I'll test this theory and report back with results in my own life.

## how can i start?

### 1. Theoretical Understanding (10-50 hrs)

- [Read $100m offers by Alex Hormozi](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58612786) to understand the value equation and how to tweak the variables in the real world.
- [Read how to sell a business](https://blog.acquire.com/acquire-biannual-acquisition-multiples-report-2024/). This is so you conceptually understand how others value your business as an entity, and you can work towards value maxxing from day 1, and [not waste time](https://twitter.com/dillionverma/status/1786065783463858582). This theory applies to any business.

### 2. Practical Experience (varies on person, but if you're focused maybe 1-5 years? hard to predict.)

you need hands on experience. you cant study your way through this one. theres no way around this.

here are the best ways to get practical experience ranked in order of effectiveness from most effective to least effective (based on my own experience)

1. get 1:1 direct mentorship from someone a few steps ahead of you
1. build something yourself
1. build something with a friend
1. join a community of builders
1. learn from an internship
1. learn from a job

there's no shortcut here. do the work. [this part is the hardest](https://twitter.com/dillionverma/status/1786784385687072895).

this theory is a WIP, ill add more to it as i discover more.

if you have evidence to support or reject this theory, please let me know on github.

thank you.
